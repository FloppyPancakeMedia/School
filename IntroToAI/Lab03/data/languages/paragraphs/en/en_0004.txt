Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as Wikipedia Day)[18] as a single English language edition with the domain name www.wikipedia.com,[W 4] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[17] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[19][20] Its integral policy of "neutral point of view" arose within its first year.[21] Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[17] Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.[22]
