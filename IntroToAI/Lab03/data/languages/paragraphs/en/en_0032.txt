Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[110][111] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[W 28] Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. Some user rights are granted automatically, such as the autoconfirmed and extended confirmed groups, when thresholds for account age and edits are met.[68]
