Academic studies of Wikipedia have shown that the average contributor to the English Wikipedia is an educated, technically inclined white male, aged 15–49, from a developed, predominantly Christian country.[207] The corresponding point of view (POV) is over-represented.[208][159] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[209][210] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[208]
