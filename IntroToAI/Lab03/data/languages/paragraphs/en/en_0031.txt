According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[W 27] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability", which generally means that the topic has been covered extensively in reliable sources that are independent of the article's subject.[105] Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized and therefore must not present original research.[106] Some subjects such as politicians and academics have specialized notability requirements.[105] Finally, Wikipedia must reflect a neutral point of view. This is accomplished through summarizing reliable sources, using impartial language, and ensuring that multiple points of view are presented based on their prominence. Information must also be verifiable.[107] Information without citations may be tagged or removed entirely.[108] This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.[109] As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.[70]
