Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[122] As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[123] Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization".[124] Since Wikipedia relies on volunteer labour, editors frequently focus on topics that interest them.[125]
