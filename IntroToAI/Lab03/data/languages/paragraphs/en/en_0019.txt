Articles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict are placed under extended-confirmed protection.[75] Editors also can make only one revert per day across the entire field and can be banned from editing related articles. These restrictions were introduced in 2008.[76] In January 2025, the Arbitration Committee introduced the "balanced editing restriction", which requires sanctioned users to devote only a third of their edits to articles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict even when no misconduct rules have been violated.[77][78]
