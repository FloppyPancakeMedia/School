In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that "one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits."[130] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[131] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[132] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[133] According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content".[134]
