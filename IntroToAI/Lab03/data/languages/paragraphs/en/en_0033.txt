Experienced editors can choose to run for "adminship",[112] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[W 29] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[W 29]
