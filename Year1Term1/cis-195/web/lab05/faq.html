			<summary>Do we offer services?</summary>

			<p>Yes, we do! That's right ladies and gentlemen, visit our contact page to submit a request. We are available for mixing services (we can master if you REALLY want, but we recommend going elsewhere. Ours would be cheap at least...). See our Tables page for a breakdown of pricing.

			We also offer scoring for your film or video game, or adding extra instruments to your existing songs. Want a drum track? Check. Looking for a backing string section to accentuate the emotional quality of a piece? Oh yeah. We can offer some of the best in virtual instrument technology with skills to match. Check out the Tables page for a detailed list of our virtual (and real) instrument library.

Currently we're interested in Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Massive Darkness 2, MAGE KNIGHT BABYYYYYY, Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion, Terraforming Mars, Dune: Imperium: Uprising, Betrayal at House on the Hill, and the occasional run of Here to Slay. Come play with us sometime.</p>
