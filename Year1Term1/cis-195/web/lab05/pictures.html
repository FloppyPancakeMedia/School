		<h3>This is an aside</h3>

		<p><img id="style-gintoki" src="images/gintoki3.jpg" alt="Uh oh..." title="Gintoki is horrified" width="175" height="125">At Floppy Pancake, we embrace eccentricity. Take this photo for instance; I am not an anime nerd, I don't watch anime, and definitely don't get emotional over some, BUT IF I DID, I would notice how overreactive the expressions of the characters are. This photo is from an episode of Gintama, where the protaganist comes into the episode realizing that he's been replaced with a different character. We see the gutwrenching horror experienced in full clarity.

		<h3>Here's the main content</h3>

		<p>Generative AI is something. That's about all I have to say at the moment. It exists. Will it replace humans? .... I personally doubt it. Take for instance this background image which was supposed to be something like "Jesus and Sam Elliot riding on a bicycle together". I think it ignored a part of the prompt but I'm charmed by the image regardless. I mean look at him. Jesus is really feelin' something. It's moody. It's tortured. He has an oversized calf-muscle and looks to be missing a leg. This shit is hilarious, man.</p>

		<p>Floppy Pancake also embraces the full nerdom of board gaming to the level of obsession. Check out this beautiful dungeon crawler, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, below. Does that not get your blood pumping? Does it not make you want to clench a fistful of dice and place bets on whether the heroes or the approaching Shadow Dragon will emerge with blood left in their veins??? Does it not make you drool at the fully modular dungeon layouts????? Oh the miniatures! Oh the tokens! Oh the cards! Sweet cards! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!!! *cough*.... Sorry, I got out of hand. In my defense, Your Honor, it's a really fun game.</p>

		<p>And of course, we can't escape admiring the beauty of things created outside of our reach as humans*. Let us observe these stunning little flowers found at the edge of the world in Florence, OR. Behold the intricacy of their coloring. Let us kneel in reverence at the design both in aesthetics and function. Such complexity in such a cute being one may pass by without even noticing.

		*Sure, we could debate the human involvement in selectively breeding plants, why not.</p>
