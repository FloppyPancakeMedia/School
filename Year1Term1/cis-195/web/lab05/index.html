			<h3>This is an aside</h3>
			<p>Oh by the way, you can find Waterfowl Dance on Bandcamp.com or basically any streaming platform. We're there. You're there. We probably won't be there together, but somehow we're still connected. Do you feel the connection? I don't. Maybe we should connect somehow. Hey, I think there's a contact page we're going to be doing.

		<h3>Here's the main content</h3>

		<p>Floppy Pancake Media is the production company headed by Cole McLain. It means nothing and we don't really do anything for the world, but it's a fun little platform under which to group various creative endeavors. From music releases, to coding projects, to board games we hope to more than half-finish, and whatever else, it is plopped under this umbrella, hopefully to be protected by the rain of a stampeding parade of critics, haters, and other bastards who just don't know what good stuff is. Because we, of course, don't, could not, and never will, make a bad product. Nope.</p>

		<p>Conceived in 2020 or so, Floppy Pancake has really only released a handful of musical records from its only artist Waterfowl Dance. Waterfowl Dance is doomed to fade into obscurity, sitting solemnly on some server rack somewhere in who-the-fuck-knows until global disaster or the company goes bankrupt and wipes its drives clean for decommissioning and probably selling to poor bastards like myself. Still, we are a proud people... Or I'm a proud person... Who is this 'we' anyway? Anybody else notice the Almighty 'We' floating in the abyss?</p>

		<p>Anyway, we also did a game once. It was called Market of Mayhem 2. There was no Market of Mayhem 1. Why make 1 when you could skip straight to 2? Unfortunately, the vision never saw full fruition although the project may be resurrected for sake of portfolio. It was a 3D arena brawler, just a chaotic mess of grocery store employees punching and throwing food at each other. But mostly we do music. Thanks for visiting.</p>
